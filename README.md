**The Goal Of The Project:**

- The goal of the system is to enable the blood donor to make an appointment by completing the Blood Donor Registration Form and Blood Donor Inquiry Form on the internet.

- The system has an administrator panel and a doctor panel. The admin panel has been developed for the necessary analysis. The doctor panel, on the other hand, sees the form filled by the future donor on the system and decides whether the donor can donate blood.

- You can access the database from the 'db' folder.
- You can access the system interface from the *'randevu'* folder.
- You can access files with database connections from the *'giris'* folder
